# The Conceptualized Self

> [Site is now live.](https://conceptualized-self.cranepresents.dev/)

This project is my Concept Demonstration project for PSY 202. This website was built using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev) framework, and hosted as a [Cloudflare Worker](https://workers.cloudflare.com).

The aim of this site is to provide a lesson on the conceptualized self that would be fitting for first-year college students learning about psychology. 

> For site design documentation, see [docs](./docs).
