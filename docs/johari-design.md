# Johari Window

The [Johari Window]() in this project takes heavy inspiration from [Kevan's Johari](https://kevan.org/johari).

Original words:[^1]

|   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|able|accepting|adaptable|bold|brave|
|calm|caring|cheerful|clever|complex|
|confident|dependable|dignified|energetic|extroverted|
|friendly|giving|happy|helpful|idealistic|
|independent|ingenious|intelligent|introverted|kind|
|knowledgeable|logical|loving|mature|modest|
|nervous|observant|organised|patient|powerful|
|proud|quiet|reflective|relaxed|religious|
|responsive|searching|self-assertive|self-conscious|sensible|
|sentimental|shy|silly|spontaneous|sympathetic|
|tense|trustworthy|warm|wise|witty|

Issues:
- Too many synonyms.
- 63 words is generally too many.
- 95% positive, needs more neutrality.

My new word proposal:

| | | | | |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| adventurous | anxious | artistic | business-minded | caretaker |
| direct | driven | energetic | extrovert | flaky |
| fulfilled | impulsive | intelligent | introvert | laid-back |
| noncommittal | organized | outsider | people-pleaser | self-centered |
| short-tempered | stubborn | tense | thoughtful | tolerant |
| traditional | troubled | uneducated | unreliable | whimsical |

```ts
['adventurous', 'anxious', 'artistic', 'business-minded', 'caretaker', 'direct', 'driven', 'energetic', 'extrovert', 'flaky', 'fulfilled', 'impulsive', 'intelligent', 'introvert', 'laid-back', 'noncommittal', 'organized', 'outsider', 'people-pleaser', 'self-centered', 'short-tempered', 'stubborn', 'tense', 'thoughtful', 'tolerant', 'traditional', 'troubled', 'uneducated', 'unreliable', 'whimsical']
```

Notes:
- I included words that I wouldn't use to describe others. I believe this will set up the exercise to possibly disprove some people's negative self-perceptions.
- There is unavoidable overlap between these words, but I hope that I kept them specific and varied enough to be meaningful.
- You will choose 4-6 words to describe yourself.[^2]

[^1] These are the only words I can find used in a Johari window.
[^2] Settled on 5 for the time being.
